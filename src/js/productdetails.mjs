// The productDetails.mjs module will be responsible for all of the functionality 
// needed to lookup data for a specific product and display it in HTML. Good modules 
// often follow a "black box" philosophy. The module should be very upfront about 
// what it needs to function, but very opaque about the details of how it accomplishes 
// it's work. This means in part that we should only expose as much as we need to for 
// it to work.
